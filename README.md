# Engineering Final PanoLapse

#### Project Title <br>
PanoLapse

####Team 
Calvin Mack, Roscoe Welch, Braden Parks

####Project Objective 

We set out to achieve a useful tool in which a typical camera 
user can use as a assistant. The micro:bit was used primarily 
with its compass and internal timer that allowed for us to actually 
pull off the panorama(compass) and the time lapse(timer).

Design Describe your design briefly and reference any supporting materials
in the assets folder. Talk about input, output, processing, and storage 
(aka memory) in your design.

Most of the code is nested while loops that keep it all separate 
and organized this does cause the problem of not being able to back up but 
it works quite well input is just the buttons A and B, Output consists of
both the LEDs on the 5x5 screen and a small pulse that makes the camera take
the picture Calvin also created a sleeve to attach the micro:bit and prevent
the camera from shorting it out as well as keep it attached for easier use while 
on the camera and prevents any dangling of the micro:bit

Development Keep a list of your development activities here, regardless of their 
success. Reference any supporting materials or external sources.

Initial testing was each person going off into their own goal Roscoe is
timelapse, Calvin with panorama, Braden with the menu system. These went
well but required a lot of planning. Braden had a hard time theorizing the menu
system and overall where to start the initial menus had a lot of conflicting
errors between the two systems

#### Testing Describe your testing approach. What was successful and what failed?

Theorizing ideas on a white board helped a lot when we would come together and 
then split off again I think it helped us just formulate ideas and come up with 
new ways to think about it Tinkering and trial and error were also great ways to 
think about things differently Braden had a lot of tinkering going on and 
constantly had to scrap code and other things

#### Demo Briefly report on the results of the in-class demo.

Calvin made a presentation and tried to go into detail about it with the
hardware we then answered questions based on it and the demo itself went really
well we got it working and were able to show off the basics of it functionality

#### Summary

Summarize your project, from idea to demo. Point out lessons learned.
Mention the most important features of the micro:bit that supported your
application.
